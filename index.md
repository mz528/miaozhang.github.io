### About me

> Welcome to my website! My name is Miao Zhang, and I'm a financial engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for quantitative finance. Before my studies at Cornell, finished my undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester.

> While I enjoy working with numbers, I also have a creative side that I like to explore through hobbies like football, music, and skateboarding. There's nothing quite like the thrill of scoring a goal or feeling the rush of adrenaline while shredding on my skateboard. But my true passion lies in music. I love attending concerts and experiencing the energy of live music. Some of my favorite artists include Queen, Imagine Dragon, One OK Rock.

> I created this website as a platform to share my experiences, interests, and ideas with the world.

> Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!

### Projects

Multi-factor stock investment and sparse Markowitz optimization (Python)
> The project developed a daily trading strategy for a portfolio of 100 stocks, using data analysis and machine learning techniques. I constructed 30 common factors, analyzed their validity, and used SVM for price prediction. To reduce transaction costs, I used optimization method with penalty terms to the Markowitz model.

Convertible Bond Simulation Pricing Model (C++)
> I built a pricing model in C++ to value convertible bonds with embedded sell options, both European and American types. I used the Crank-Nicolson scheme to solve the Black-Scholes equation and analyzed the impact of parameters on bond prices using PDE(Greeks). The model was tested with real market data and the numerical scheme's efficiency and stability were improved by adjusting the simulation range and grids.
