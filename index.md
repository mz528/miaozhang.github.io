### About me

> Welcome to my website! My name is Miao Zhang, and I'm a financial engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for quantitative finance. Before my studies at Cornell, finished my undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester.

> While I enjoy working with numbers, I also have a creative side that I like to explore through hobbies like football, music, and skateboarding. There's nothing quite like the thrill of scoring a goal or feeling the rush of adrenaline while shredding on my skateboard. But my true passion lies in music. I love attending concerts and experiencing the energy of live music. Some of my favorite artists include Queen, Imagine Dragon, One OK Rock.

> I created this website as a platform to share my experiences, interests, and ideas with the world.

> Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
